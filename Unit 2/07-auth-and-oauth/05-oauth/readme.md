# OAuth

1. Before you add any kind of authentication, first answer the following questions:

- What is OAuth? 
- Why is there an OAuth 1 and OAuth 2?
- What is a client ID?
- What is a client secret?
- What is a redirect URL?
- What is an authorization code or grant?
- What is an access token?
- What is a refresh token?
- Diagram / List the steps of an OAuth flow

2. Add OAuth to your users and messages app! Allow users to log in with their email and password as well as log in through Twitter!
